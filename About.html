				This is no just paper, this is <i>Paper</i>. A thing you have never seen.
				<br><br> This is an oppertunity to see more then you could and be more then you are. Made using fibres and science, this is the next step for humanity. <br><br> The core of the ItsApaper is a desire, a desire to fufill. There is a aching gap within the people for something more then just a tool, something more then just an object, something that will be <span class="redacted">our friend</span>. <br> <br>
				ItsApaper was created in order to help the world achieve the best form of communication in history. Paper has been misunderstood for a long time. The creation of Paper is largely ignored. We intend to change this. <br> <br>
				How is Paper made? <br> <br>
				Grind down the trees, mulching, drying blah blah blah! Why get bogged down with the details? Just enjoy the product.

				ItsAnovah was born in <span class="redacted"> 2004 </span> and from the moment she was born, she knew she loved Paper. The <i> feel </i>, the <i>grace</i> and (most of all) the utility. <br> <br>
				Paper is something that few people actually think about but ItsAnovah has never once stopped. When questioned about her love for Paper, ItsAnovah states that: <br> <br>
				"Paper is so good, mmmmmmmm yes Paper, the best, for<font color="white">E</font>real<font color="white">A</font>for<font color="white">T</font>real for<font color="white">T</font>real<font color="white">H</font>for<font color="white">E</font>real for<font color="white">P</font>real<font color="white">A</font>for<font color="white">P</font>real<font color="white">E</font>for<font color="white">R</font>real. F O R  R E A L" <br> <br>
				We are so happy to have the world famous ItsAnovah on bored with our Company. ItsAnovah has done a lot of research on Paper and the best ways to make, bake and sell Paper using new techniques that have been previously unheard of.
